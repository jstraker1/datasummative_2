    "To do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Test H3. Analyse how lifestyle factors influence medical risk markers - Use scatter plots and multiple linear regressions to see how lifestyle behaviours relate to BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and other medical variables. Lifestyle behaviours are the predictor and the medical risk factors are the dependent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Test H4. Identify which medical risk factors predict each disease - Fit linear regressions that include medical markers to build richer models and compare these to the lifestyle only models. Similarly, the disease is the predictor, and the medical risk factor is the dependent variable. Also use scatter plots for further analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Discuss limitations and validity - Address synthetic data issues, cross sectional design, model assumptions, and the educational nature of the tool. "
